          <p>Lucky Dube’s Early Life?</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lucky Philip Dube was a South African reggae musician and
            Rastafarian. Lucky Dube was born in Ermelo, formerly of the Eastern
            Transvaal, now of Mpumalanga.

          <p>
            His parents separated before his birth and so he was raised by a
            single mother, Sarah. His mother named him Lucky because of the
            failed pregnancies before his birth. He has two siblings Patrick and
            Thandi Dube. Lucky Dube drew inspiration from Jimmy Cliff and Peter
            Tosh, he felt the socio-political messages associated with Jamaican
            reggae were relevant to a South African audience in an
            institutionally racist society. Lucky was a farmer in his early
            life. After realizing farming did not meet the cost of living at the
            time, he decided to back to school.

          <p>Lucky Dube’s Music career?</p>
          <br />
          <p>
            While in school, he joined the choir, where his love for music
            began. He and his friends formed his first musical ensemble, called
            The Skyway Band. At the age of 18 Dube joined his cousin's band, The
            Love Brothers, playing Zulu pop music known as Mbaqanga whilst
            funding his lifestyle by working for Hole and Cooke as a security
            guard at the car auctions in Midrand. The Love Brothers later signed
            to Teal Record Company, under Richard Siluma. Under the label, Lucky
            and The Love Brothers recorded their first studio album Lucky Dube
            and the Supersoul.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Lucky Dube and the Supersoul became a brand for the South African
            icon for a while.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            On the release of his fifth album, Dave Segal (who became Dube's
            sound engineer) encouraged him to drop the "Supersoul" element of
            the name. All subsequent albums were recorded as Lucky Dube. At this
            time Dube began to note fans were responding positively to some
            reggae songs he played during live concerts. He recorded 22 albums
            in Zulu, English and Afrikaans in a 25-year period and was South
            Africa's best and biggest-selling reggae artist.
